 Hello and this is my application for a random password generator. 
 This application will help randomize a password for you at the touch of just a few clicks.
 Depending on if you want the password to be short or long you can choose anywhere between 8-50 characters.
 When you are done you may copy it to clipboard to save to your keychain or anyother place you deem safe.
 It is simple yet effective so... ENJOY!
